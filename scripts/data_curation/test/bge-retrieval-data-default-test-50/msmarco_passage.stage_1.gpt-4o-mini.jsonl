Observational learning is a process in which a person observes another person's behavior and the consequences of the behavior. If the consequences are positive, the person may imitate the behavior. Imagine you wish to be a comic. You observe comics at an open mike event. This allows you to gain insight into the statements and behaviors of people who strive to be funny. This is one example of observational learning. Now imagine you have accepted a job in sales. However, you have no sales experience. Thus, on your first day you observe an experienced salesperson.
